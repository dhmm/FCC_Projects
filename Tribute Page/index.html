                    <h4>Gremio - 1999</h4>
                    <p>Ronaldinho's career began with the Grêmio youth squad. He made his senior side debut during the
                        1998 Copa Libertadores.[21] 1999 saw the emergence of the 18-year-old Ronaldinho, with 23 goals
                        in 48 matches, and he put in headlining displays in derbies against Internacional, most notably
                        on 20 June 1999 in the Rio Grande do Sul State Championship final.[22] In a match-winning
                        performance, Ronaldinho embarrassed Internacional's Brazilian legend and 1994 World Cup-winning
                        captain Dunga, flicking the ball over his head on one occasion, and leaving him flat-footed in a
                        mazy dribble on another.[22] Ronaldinho achieved further success with Grêmio, winning the
                        inaugural Copa Sul-Minas.[22]</p>

                    <h4>PSG - 2001</h4>
                    <p>In 2001, Ronaldinho signed a five-year contract with French club Paris Saint-Germain in a €5
                        million transfer.[26] Upon his arrival in Paris, Ronaldinho was given the number 21 shirt and
                        inserted into a lineup that included fellow Brazilian Aloísio, midfielder Jay-Jay Okocha and
                        striker Nicolas Anelka.[27]</p>
                    <p>Ronaldinho made his league debut for the club on 4 August 2001, appearing as a substitute in a
                        1–1 draw with Auxerre.[28] Ronaldinho spent the majority of the first few months of the 2001–02
                        season alternated between the bench and starter's role. He scored his first goal for the club on
                        13 October in a 2–2 draw against Lyon, converting the equalizing penalty in the 79th minute
                        after having come on ten minutes prior.[29] After returning from the winter break, Ronaldinho
                        went on a tear, scoring a goal in four consecutive matches to open the new campaign. He recorded
                        impressive goals against Monaco, Rennes, Lens and Lorient. On 16 March 2002, he recorded a
                        double in PSG's 3–1 victory against relegation strugglers Troyes.[30] He scored his final league
                        goal of the season in the club's 2–0 win over Metz on 27 April.[31]</p>

                    <h4>Barcelona - 2004</h4>
                    <p>Newly elected FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta stated, "I said we would lead Barça to the
                        forefront of the footballing world, and for that to occur we had to sign one of these three
                        players, David Beckham, Thierry Henry or Ronaldinho".[35] Henry remained with Arsenal, and
                        Laporta then promised to bring Beckham to the club, but following his transfer to Real Madrid,
                        Barcelona entered the running for Ronaldinho and outbid Manchester United for his signature in a
                        €30 million deal.[36][37]</p>
